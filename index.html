      <h2>Story of Conrad & belly in 3 books</h2>
      <p>
        Belly has always been in love with Conrad since childhood. At her sixteenth summer, she becomes more mature and finally gets noticed. Conrad, who is usually distant and mysterious, secretly has feelings for her too. However, he struggles to express them because of family problems (especially Susannah’s illness). Their relationship is full of push-and-pull: Belly wants Conrad to care, while Conrad refuses to open his heart. In the end, Belly realizes her love for Conrad is strong, though complicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Susannah’s death, Conrad becomes even more withdrawn. Belly feels disappointed because Conrad keeps disappearing and cannot give her clarity. Jeremiah steps in as the one who is always there for her, which makes Belly question her feelings. Still, her love for Conrad never truly fades, even though he feels out of reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the final book, Belly tries to move on by being in a serious relationship with Jeremiah. They even get engaged. But as the wedding approaches, Belly realizes her heart has always belonged to Conrad. Conrad finally admits that he has always loved her, even if he was afraid to lose her. In the end, Belly calls off the wedding with Jeremiah and chooses Conrad. They marry, proving that despite all the struggles, Belly and Conrad are meant to be together.
